Super-NetOps is the practice of delivering network-based services as programmable infrastructure to support DevOps practices and methodologies. 

World Wide Technology is a platinum sponsor of F5 Agility 2018. The event is being held at the Boston Convention and Expo Center August 13th â€“ 16th 2018. In the F5 Agility breakout session, _Super-NetOps Source of Truth_, we examine how the role of an infrastructure engineer will evolve under the Super-NetOps service delivery methodology. 

Please visit the WWT blog, [Super-NetOps Source of Truth](https://www2.wwt.com/all-blog/super-netops-source-truth/) to learn why the Super_NetOps engineer must focus on how the input data is stored, maintained and updated to create and define services on infrastructure.

This GitHub Repository provides code samples and links to resources for the Super-NetOps practitioner.

The slide deck for the live presentation is available on Slideshare at [Super-NetOps Source of Truth](https://www.slideshare.net/joelwking/supernetops-source-of-truth-110053045)

The key message of this talk is:
 * View IT operations as a flow of data (Sources of Truth) thru work-cells (automation processes)  to deliver value to the customer.
 * There should be only one source of truth for every piece of configuration data. 
 * Device configurations are poor source of truth.
