Super-NetOps is the practice of delivering network-based services as programmable infrastructure to support DevOps practices and methodologies. 

World Wide Technology is a platinum sponsor of F5 Agility 2018. The event is being held at the Boston Convention and Expo Center August 13th â€“ 16th 2018. In the F5 Agility breakout session, _Super-NetOps Source of Truth_, we examine how the role of an infrastructure engineer will evolve under the Super-NetOps service delivery methodology. 

This GitHub Repository provides code samples and links to resources for the Super-NetOps practitioner.
